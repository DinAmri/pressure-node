    <hr class="modal-hr-small">

    <div class="modal-content">
        <p>FIFA has released initial ticket pricing for the 2026 World Cup, to be hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.</p>

        <p>The response has been immediate and hostile, particularly in the UK and across Europe.</p>

        <p>Early pricing indicates a sharp increase compared with the previous tournament in Qatar. In several cases, comparable tickets are multiples higher, with prices for marquee fixtures — including the final — reaching levels more familiar to US professional sports than international football.</p>

        <p>For the first time, FIFA is also introducing dynamic pricing for World Cup tickets.</p>

        <p>Prices are no longer fixed. They fluctuate based on demand, timing, and the perceived attractiveness of each match.</p>

        <p>This shift has collided with long-standing expectations of the World Cup as a broadly accessible, culturally shared event.</p>

        <p>Critics have resurfaced claims from the United 2026 bid process, where early documents suggested tickets could be available from $21.</p>

        <p>Those low-cost options appear absent or severely constrained in the initial release.</p>

        <p>Supporter organisations, including Football Supporters Europe (FSE) and the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA), have publicly condemned the pricing model and called for a halt to ticket sales pending consultation.</p>

        <p>Public language has escalated quickly — from frustration to accusations of betrayal.</p>

        <p>At face value, this looks like a pricing dispute.</p>

        <p><strong>PressureNode assumes it is something else.</strong></p>

    <h3 class="modal-section-title">2. Surface Signals</h3>
    <hr class="modal-hr-small">

    <div class="modal-content">
        <p><strong>The dominant public response has been framed as outrage.</strong></p>

        <p>Headlines describe the pricing as “extortionate,” “scandalous,” and “a betrayal of fans.” Comparisons with Qatar 2022 circulate widely, often expressed as multiples.</p>

        <p><strong>Supporter organisations moved quickly.</strong></p>

        <p>Statements from FSE and the FSA condemn both absolute prices and dynamic pricing as exclusionary and opaque.</p>

        <p><strong>On social media, the language turns visceral.</strong></p>

        <p>Fans speak less about affordability and more about loss — of access, tradition, and ownership.</p>

        <p><strong>FIFA’s response remains technical.</strong></p>

        <p>Backlash is treated as a reaction to pricing mechanics, not a challenge to identity.</p>

        <p><strong>Different actors, same conclusion.</strong></p>

        <p>What surfaces is not anger alone, but dispossession.</p>

    <h3 class="modal-section-title">3. Structural Context</h3>
    <hr class="modal-hr-small">

    <div class="modal-content">
        <p><strong>The World Cup no longer operates as a single-host, single-market event.</strong></p>

        <p>The 2026 tournament spans three countries, multiple time zones, and a vastly expanded footprint.</p>

        <p><strong>This reshapes the economic baseline.</strong></p>

        <p>Matchday attendance is no longer the primary driver. Broadcasting, sponsorship, hospitality, and partnerships dominate.</p>

        <p><strong>Ticketing becomes a yield-optimised layer.</strong></p>

        <p>This trajectory predates 2026. Globalisation shifted football’s centre of gravity away from local supporters.</p>

        <p><strong>Qatar 2022 was an anomaly.</strong></p>

        <p>Compact, subsidised, politically priced.</p>

        <p><strong>North America reasserts market logic.</strong></p>

        <p>Dynamic pricing, premium segmentation, and willingness-to-pay stratification.</p>

        <p><strong>The pricing release did not create tension.</strong></p>

        <p>It exposed it.</p>

    <hr class="modal-hr-small">

    <div class="modal-content">
        <p><strong>At the top sits FIFA.</strong></p>

        <p>Optimising for revenue stability and partner satisfaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Host markets reinforce segmentation.</strong></p>

        <p>Yield maximisation over uniform affordability.</p>

        <p><strong>Sponsors prioritise access, not price.</strong></p>

        <p>Allocation matters more than cost.</p>

        <p><strong>Global travellers absorb the increase.</strong></p>

        <p>Tickets bundle into once-in-a-lifetime experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>Legacy fans carry emotional weight.</strong></p>

        <p>But limited leverage.</p>

        <p><strong>No actor needs hostility.</strong></p>

        <p>The system rewards everyone else more.</p>

    <hr class="modal-hr-small">

    <div class="modal-content">
        <p>The pressure node is not the ticket price.</p>

        <p><strong>It is the reclassification of the World Cup.</strong></p>

        <p>The tournament has crossed from participatory cultural event to globally priced entertainment asset.</p>

        <p>Universality becomes narrative.</p>

        <p>Scarcity becomes mechanism.</p>

        <p>The stadium is no longer communal space.</p>

        <p><strong>It is a premium interface.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Crowds change.</strong></p>

        <p>Atmosphere becomes curated rather than organic.</p>

        <p><strong>Culture thins.</strong></p>

        <p>The tournament becomes something you consume, not something you belong to.</p>

        <p><strong>Legitimacy decays quietly.</strong></p>

        <p>Not collapse — indifference.</p>

        <p><strong>Pricing logic normalises upward.</strong></p>
